WELCOME TO XWF PRESENTS DEATHMATCH!

Hello! First off, if you're into cool stories with larger-than-life characters in a bizarre world where anything is possible, consider checking out xwf99.com!

Second of all... The XWF and its roster has gotten surprisingly into the Ned Kaye Invitational Deathmatch Tournament, which has thrown like five tournaments up to this point.

Only... it turns out the XWF was using third-party software this whole time and by agreeing to terms and services, didn't make a dime. THIS INJUSTICE WILL NOT STAND! THE XWF IS GOING TO MAKE ITS OWN DEATHMATCH! WITH BLACKJACK! AND HOOKERS!

Developer's Note:
I have no idea how long this project will take. This is my second discord bot. But, I'll do my best to make progress when I have downtime!

I will make the link to add the bot publicly available once we've got at least basic deathmatch functional.

How To Invite Our Discord Bot to your server:
https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=928688773225656400&permissions=429497117760&scope=bot

Example on Usage:
Once the bot has been invited, any user in the discord server can type:

```--xwf-deathmatch @User1 @User2```

And the deathmatch will commence!

If you don't have tag a second user, your first user will fight a jobber. If you don't tag any users, you're sending two jobbers into the death pit.
